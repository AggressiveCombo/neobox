# Neobox

Neobox is an experimental, fully open-source alternative to hitbox.io.

## Why?

Hitbox.io has many issues.  
These include bugs, memory leaks, and exploits (see <https://hitbox.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches> as an example).  
This results in an unpleasant experience, especially for competitive and longer-session players.

I believe in open-source, and a project such as this is an immensely useful learning exercise,  
while at the same time fixing a game I enjoy.  

## Goals / Motivation

For there to be a useful alternative, it needs to be better than the original.  
This is why I have set up some goals I believe the project needs to be an improvement over the original.  

###  Highly Performant  
<ul> Even small maps on hitbox.io (with a low amount of physics objets) can get very laggy on old-ish systems with more than a couple of players.  
Improving performance would make playing more accessible to more players. </ul>

### Scalable  
<ul> Hitbox.io only allows up to 10 players per lobby. This is fine for simpler maps, but for FFA maps, this is quite inadequate. </ul>

### Maintainable  
<ul> Chaz, the developer of hitbox.io has not updated their game in more than a year. The fact that their game is closed-source means that no-one else can contribute to the game.  
This means that a serious bug or vulnerability won't get fixed nearly as fast as one found on an open-source project will. </ul>
